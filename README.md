### Record Label API ⚫
---

API implemented for academic purposes as part of a MERN stack e-commerce project for an indie record label. 

Developed using technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize ORM (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** & **JWT**.

It provides CRUD functionality with database level validation for diverse entities: users, administrators, products, artists, categories & orders, as well as JWT authentication for both users and administrators.
